# Notes

I spent some time finding a plucky open-source song and I spent time manually splitting each note into a new track, so that they could be exported into individual sound files. It would be interesting to spend some time studying audio engineering so that I could learn 1) how to do these kinds of mixes more easily and 2) generate my own sounds programmatically based on how the ball hits the circles.
